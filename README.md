# Secure Password Validation API

This project is a solution for the **Secure Password Challenge**, developed to improve my knowledge and deepen my understanding of API development and password security mechanisms.

## Overview

The **Secure Password Validation API** is a Spring Boot application designed to validate the strength of passwords. The API accepts a password via a POST request and checks its security level using regular expressions (Regex). This project was created as part of my ongoing efforts to enhance my skills in Java, Spring Boot, and Regex.

## Features

- **Password Validation**: The API evaluates passwords based on specific security criteria.
- **Error Reporting**: If the password does not meet the security requirements, the API returns a list of all the errors found.
- **Regex Implementation**: Utilizes regular expressions to enforce security rules.
- **Spring Boot**: Built using the Spring Boot framework for robust and efficient API development.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Regex**

## How It Works

1. **POST Request**: Submit a password to the API via a POST request.
2. **Validation**: The API processes the password using pre-defined Regex patterns to determine its security level.
3. **Error Reporting**: If the password fails validation, the API returns a detailed list of all the security errors.
4. **Response**: The API returns a response indicating whether the password meets the required security standards and lists any errors if it does not.

## Purpose

This project was undertaken to challenge myself and to study more about password validation techniques in the context of API development. It is a hands-on exercise aimed at enhancing my understanding and skills in the technologies mentioned above.
